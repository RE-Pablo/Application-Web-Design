## 6th Semester | Engineering in software development
#### I've got interests on *Big data* data using *Python* (Pandas) or *R* to train neural connections and manage information to solve a problem, and I like to think of the best way to solve it. Also, the use of languages with porpouse in databases is something that I focus on learning because I am used to using *SQL*, *PHP*, and other environments to arrange a database like *MongoDB* or *MySQL*.

### About me

Now I'm studying my 6th semester of engineering in *Software Development* at *Universidad TecMilenio*, where I have been the leader of multiple student groups (**Spirits and Enactus**) with 1 and a half years of experience in fundraising collaboration and event management. I am experienced in the organization of integrative activities aimed at students and teachers. My approach is based on an openness to listen and offer strategic alternatives, always in line with the established hierarchy.

Important Events:

+ Organization of the **Ford Driving Skills For Life Mexico** event in person for +200 students with activities and talks on road awareness focused on University students.
+ Project focused on developing the health and well-being objective (ONU) for which the talk “Breast Cancer” was coordinated at Cetis4 with 30 students on awareness and information about foundations that help patients with breast cancer.
