## 6th Semester | Engineering in software development

#### I've got interests on *Big data* data using *Python* (Pandas) or *R* to train neural connections and manage information to solve a problem, and I like to think of the best way to solve it. Also, the use of languages with porpouse in databases is something that I focus on learning because I am used to using *SQL*, *PHP*, and other environments to arrange a database like *MongoDB* or *MySQL*.
